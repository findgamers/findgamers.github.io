    <h1>What We Know</h1>
    <div class="know">
      <p>Not much is known about what happened, but we know that the owner went missing before Gamer's closed (and maybe the reason why it is               closed). 
	      He was acting very strange a few days before he went missing. 
	      Usually he would greet and welcome all his customers and staff workers, but those few days he would just hide in his office and never set 				foot outside until closing time.</p>
