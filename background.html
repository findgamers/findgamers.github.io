    <h1>Background of Gamer's</h1>
    <div class="background">
      <p>"<em>Gamer's Lounge</em>" is a lounge for kids and grown up alike to play games such as: Virtual Reality, Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo, 					Board Games, Comics, and much more. 
        You could set up a party and have as much game time as the party members wanted. 
        The main attraction was the animatronic “Gamer” and his V.I.P. party room. The kids loved him. 
        The company made a few training and safety videos for both the Staff and the customers.</p>
